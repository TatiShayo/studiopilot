# StudioPilot Learnings & Known Issues


MANDATORY STARTUP SEQUENCE (do every session):
1. git log --oneline -10 (understand what was done)
2. npm run build 2>&1 | tail -30 (find current errors)
3. npx tsc --noEmit 2>&1 | head -20 (TypeScript errors)
4. Read PLAN.md (find current phase, first unchecked task)
5. Read LEARNINGS.md (check for known issues to avoid)
6. If any [BLOCKED] tasks in PLAN.md, attempt them again with fresh approach

LOOP PROTOCOL:
Read PLAN.md → find first [ ] task in lowest-numbered incomplete phase → implement → verify → git commit → mark [x] → continue immediately. Never stop. Never ask. Never wait.

If a task fails after 2 attempts: log to LEARNINGS.md as [BLOCKED: reason], skip.
Web search any error you can't immediately solve.
Install any npm package needed without asking.
Commit after every completed task.

TARGET: Complete all remaining 22 tasks in PLAN.md. Start now.
